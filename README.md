# AIG Model Matching
This repository will be updated twice per month, adding the latest and greatest liveries to your simulators. The VMR file can be used with any software that supports a VMR file, the VMR file has been manually created by me with the help of ModelMatchingMagic, there is a pretty large portion of aircraft that do not have an ICAO type etc assigned so I have taken the time to manually enter these for the respectfull entries.

## Installation
Do not download this repository directly, this repository does not contain the texture files etc. Instead use the following link to download the .zip with all the available liveries, last updated **26/07/22**
